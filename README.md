## Executive Summary
- Zentro management lacked visibility into transaction-level data, struggling to track performance across regions and product categories over a 5-year period.
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard consolidating 49,000+ transactions to track KPIs, sales trends, and customer behavior.
- Delivered a centralized, data-driven reporting solution enabling stakeholders to track over $63M in sales, identify a 7.8% return-rate spike in 2023, and validate post-2023 policies. The analysis highlighted Electronics & Gadgets as the top revenue driver, balanced payment behavior, and the UK as a key growth market, guiding targeted marketing and regional strategy.

##  The Business Problem
Zentro required a data-driven approach to understand their sales performance from January 2020 to September 2025. The stakeholders' primary objective was to move away from static reporting to a dynamic view that could support informed business decisions.

## Key Questions Addressed:
- How have Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) changed YoY?
- Which product categories and regions are lagging?
- What are the preferred customer payment channels?

## The Process (Methodology)
### Tools Used:
Power BI, Power Query, DAX

### Data Sourcing & Overview
The dataset consists of approximately 49,000 transactions with 16 columns, covering operations across all current locations.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)
Using Power Query, the raw data was transformed to ensure accuracy:
- Removed duplicate entries from the dataset.
- Corrected Product Category naming conventions and standardized Payment Method (e.g., renamed paypall to PayPal).
- Created a new SalesAmount calculated column.
